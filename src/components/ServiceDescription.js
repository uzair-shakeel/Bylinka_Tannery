        Characteristics of Reindeer Skins
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-6 md:leading-8 py-3 text-justify text-sm md:text-md">
        Reindeer skins are exceptionally resistant to low temperatures and
        moisture, making them an ideal material for winter clothing, footwear,
        and interior design elements such as carpets or covers. The natural
        texture and subtle, yet distinct, pattern of their fur add elegance and
        warmth to every product.

        Tanning Process
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-6 md:leading-8 py-3 text-justify text-sm md:text-md">
        Each skin is carefully selected and manually cleaned to remove any
        impurities. This stage is crucial to preserve the natural properties of
        the reindeer skin.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-6 md:leading-8 py-3 text-justify text-sm md:text-md">
        We use a specially developed tanning method that enhances the natural
        durability of the skin and protects it from harmful external factors.
        Our tanning processes are environmentally friendly, ensuring that the
        final product is both beautiful and ecologically sustainable.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-6 md:leading-8 py-3 text-justify text-sm md:text-md">
        The skins are gently dyed to highlight their natural color while
        preserving the unique fur pattern. Then, the skins are finished with
        techniques that increase their softness and flexibility, important for
        user comfort.{" "}
