        Our medical grade leathers are tanned using specially selected methods
        that minimize the risk of allergic reactions and skin irritation. We use
        aluminum-based tannins known for their gentle action and compliance with
        the stringent hygiene standards required in medicine. Each batch of
        leather undergoes rigorous quality testing to ensure it meets medical
        standards.

        Our medical leathers are used in the production of dressings, orthopedic
        straps, medical clothing elements, and other accessories that come into
        direct contact with patients' skin. Their delicacy and softness make
        them ideal for individuals with sensitive skin and those requiring
        special care in managing skin conditions or injuries.
